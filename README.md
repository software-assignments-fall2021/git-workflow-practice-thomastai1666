GPT-3 is a general deep learning model that is not only able to generate human like text, but also can generate code snippets and perform other language tasks. Although these types of general language AI models are not new, this model has a large number of parameters and has high accuracy. What makes Github Copilot interesting is that it augments the role of the program; in the future this tool could completely replace the role of the programmer in companies.

However, like all machine learning models it is susceptible to bias and other unintended side effects as a result of bad training data. When scraping public code, it also picked up bugs that could cause threats. NYU researchers found that 40% of the programs generated by Copilot had security vulnerabilities. The impact that AI has on technology will have huge impacts on society and our lives in the future. It is important that we take caution when approaching novel technologies such as Copilot and not rely on it too heavily.
